<p>Also known as Spice, K2, Bath Salts, Kronic, Bromo-Dragonfly, Mushroom, Synthetic Cannabis, BZP, TFMPP and Mephedrone, new psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances that mimic the effects of other controlled drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine, Ecstasy, methamphetamine or heroin. NPS are produced by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of existing NPS and controlled drugs to create new variations that are not yet controlled.</p>
<p>Effects of use: severe intoxications, severe toxic reactions leading to death, paranoia, hallucinations, adverse cardiovascular problems, renal failure and seizures</p>

<p>Also known as Subutex, Tec and Su Su, Buprenorphine comes in 2 mg and 8 mg pills and is a semi-synthetic opioid derivative closely related to Morphine. It is taken sublingually i.e.&nbsp;place under the tongue until it dissolves. Abusers also mix it with other prescription drugs and inject it for a greater high</p>
<p>Effects of use: sedation, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, vomiting</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms: delirium tremens, clouding of consciousness and severe tremors or seizures, anxiety, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, muscle and joint pains and insomnia</p>
<p><em>Ecstasy</em><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Ecstasy refers to tablets containing Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) and/or Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). These tablets come in different colours with different logos stamped on them and are often sold in discos as well as night joints. People take them to enable them to dance all night and sometimes they die from exhaustion and dehydration. Other controlled drugs such as Ketamine and Ice, and chemicals such as paracetamol and calcium carbonate are often mixed with ecstasy by abusers.</p>
<p>Effects of use: increased heart rate and blood pressure, jaw clenching, teeth grinding and uncontrollable shaking, kidney, liver and brain damage and long-term memory loss, chills, sweating and vomiting, inability to think, see and co-ordinate properly and hallucinations</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, depression and uncontrollable fear, insomnia and loss of control of senses and reality</p>
<p><em>Erimin 5</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="erimin5.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="331"></p>

</div>
<p>Also known as Nimetazepam, ‘Erimin-5’ is a type of depressant taken orally by the user in tablet form to help them to calm down and sleep. Excessive use will however lead to harmful effects.</p>
<p>Effects of use: loss of consciousness, distorted judgement, sight and thinking, difficulty in speaking, moving and co-ordinating bodily functions as well as poor memory and concentration</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms: anxiety and jittery feelings, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, quickened heart beat, excessive sweating, violent shaking and stomach cramps, mental confusion and fits</p>
<p><em>Yaba</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="ice_ya ba.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="244"></p>

<p>A variant of Ice or Methamphetamine in tablet form, it is also known as Crazy Horse Pill. Most of the Yaba tablets found in Singapore are embossed with the ‘WY’ logo and are green or orange in colour. It is highly addictive and is a strong stimulant, with a very strong effect on the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Effects of use/Withdrawal symptoms: disorientation, apathy, confused exhaustion, strong psychological dependence, psychosis, depression, damage to the brain similar to Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and epilepsy, aggression and violent behaviour, anxiety, confusion, insomnia and auditory hallucinations</p>
<p>Physical effects of use: permanent damage to blood vessels of heart and brain, high blood pressure leading to heart attacks, strokes and death, liver, kidney and lung damage, destruction of tissues in nose if sniffed, respiratory (breathing) problems if smoked, infectious diseases and abscesses if injected, malnutrition, weight loss and severe tooth decay</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-implications-of-trends-of-drug-types-in-singapore">Analysis &amp; Implications of Trends of Drug Types in Singapore</h2>
<p>While the statistics on each type of drug seized in Singapore over the years as displayed here can provide some form of a reliable illustration of the popular drug types and the demand for them, they should not be taken as fully indicative of the actual trends on the ground. For instance, some drug types could be significant yet not reflected here due to more covert operations that have thus far managed to escape surveillance and enforcement. However, due to the lack of such data, the current statistics available on drug types seized remain the most reliable form of data for analysis of their popularity.</p>
<p>Overall, there have been differing trends for different types of drugs from 2003 to 2021. Some have boomed in popularity, some have grown out of significance, others have remained stagnantly present. It is crucial to study the local trends surrounding these particular drugs, and their correlations with global drug trends, to be able to design more targeted and effective solutions such as in the form of aftercare programmes for abusers as well as enforcement strategies to root out and seize drug hotspots.</p>
<p>Drugs that have ostensibly been increasing in popularity include <em>Cannabis</em>, <em>Heroin</em>, <em>Ice</em> and <em>New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, drugs that seem to have been losing or lost popularity include <em>Heroin No.4</em>, <em>Opium</em>, <em>Buprenorphine</em>, <em>Erimin 5</em> and <em>Yaba</em>.</p>
<p>Drugs that have largely stagnated while persisting are <em>Ketamine</em> and <em>Ecstasy</em>.</p>
<p>Based on these deductions, the CNB could direct their strategies and resources to focus more on drugs that have been increasing in popularity as well as those that have persisted despite stagnating. While data on tendency of abuse of certain types of drugs amongst different age groups is not publicly available at the moment, the CNB could derive certain patterns from their own records to better inform its strategies of <a href="./index.html"><em>Preventive Drug Education (PDE)</em></a> and <a href="./index.html"><em>Structured Rehabilitation &amp; Aftercare Programmes</em></a>.</p>
<p>For instance, since <em>Ketamine</em> is recognised as being common at dance parties<sup>2</sup>, the CNB could channel their efforts into surveillance and enforcement at places like night clubs and dance party events to seize potential drug abusers and suppliers. The rising trend of <em>Cannabis</em> seems to also be in line with greater attention on the substances and shifting attitudes towards it given its increasing legalisation around the world<sup>4</sup>. It is also popular as a first drug in Singapore, according to a survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)<sup>5</sup>. This CNA documentary examines the reasons for the growing popularity of the drug amongst youths.</p>
