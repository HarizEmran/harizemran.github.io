    "text": "The issue of drug abuse and addiction is one that still needs to be addressed and given due attention in Singapore. The nation-state is known for its harsh punishment of crime and has one of the toughest drug laws in the world, especially with regards to its execution of individuals for narcotic offences, which has drawn considerable international criticism and pressure for reform1.\nYet, drug trafficking remains rife, with a recent bust witnessing drugs worth S$473,000 being seized2. A total of 2,826 drug abusers were arrested in 2022, a 4% increase from the year before3. The situation amongst youth is provides further case for concern. There was a 10.1% rise in the total number of drug abusers below 20 years old arrested between 2016 and 20204.\nThere are a multitude of types of drugs being abused in Singapore and we look at some of the more common ones in Popular Drug Types."

    "text": "While there might be a myriad of undocumented drug types being abused in Singapore, the more popular ones can be deduced by looking at the more common ones being seized by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) over the years1 that are displayed here according to the different units of measurement that they were recorded in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nCannabis2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Marijuana, Pot, Grass, Joints, Ganja, Hashish and Weed, Cannabis come from any part of a plant of the genus Cannabis and contains THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) which affect one’s mood as well as concentration and memory which weakens the abuser’s ability to learn.\nEffects of short-term use: impaired short-term memory, impaired motor co-ordination and possibility of paranoia and psychosis in high doses\nEffects of long-term or heavy use: addiction, altered brain development, impaired neural connectivity in specific brain regions, cognitive impairment, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and poor education outcome\nWithdrawal symptoms: anxiety, irritability, sleeping difficulties and craving for the drug\nHeroin2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as White, Smack, Junk, Powder, Putih, Medicine and Ubat, Heroin is a powerful and very addictive drug that comes in granular, powder or solution form. Heroin No. 4 is white in colour while Heroin No. 3 is more yellowish. Heroin abusers feel dull and tired very easily and are also not able to concentrate. “Chasing the Dragon” is a common method of abuse used by Heroin abusers here that involves heating the Heroin powder and sniffing the fumes through a rolled note.\nEffects of use: lowered heart rate and respiration, damage to lungs, kidneys and liver, dull feeling and tiredness, difficulty in concentrating and constipation\nWithdrawal symptoms: insomnia, watery eyes and runny nose, irritable and jittery feelings, tremors and bodily cramps, chills and sweating as well as diarrhoea and vomiting\nIce2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Methamphetamine, Glass, Crystal, Speed, Quartz, Ice Cream, Hirropon, Shabu or Syabu that usually comes in the form of a colourless and odourless crystal that resembles glass fragments or shiny blue-white “rocks” of various sizes. It is highly addictive and is a strong stimulant, with a very strong effect on the central nervous system.\nEffects of use/Withdrawal symptoms: disorientation, apathy, confused exhaustion, strong psychological dependence, psychosis, depression, damage to the brain similar to Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and epilepsy, aggression and violent behaviour, anxiety, confusion, insomnia and auditory hallucinations\nPhysical effects of use: permanent damage to blood vessels of heart and brain, high blood pressure leading to heart attacks, strokes and death, liver, kidney and lung damage, destruction of tissues in nose if sniffed, respiratory (breathing) problems if smoked, infectious diseases and abscesses if injected, malnutrition, weight loss and severe tooth decay\nKetamine2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as K, Special K, Vitamin K and Kit Kat, Ketamine is an anaesthetic for veterinary as well as human use and the drug takes the form of a white crystalline powder, liquid or tablet. As a drug of abuse in Hong Kong, the United States and Australia, it has become common at dance parties. It produces a progression of effects on the abuser, from a state of dreamy intoxication to delirium accompanied by the inability to move, feel pain or remember what has occurred under the drug’s influence. The effects of Ketamine last an hour or less but the drug can affect the senses, judgement and co-ordination for 18 to 24 hours.\nEffects of use: inability to move, distorted judgement, perception, hearing, sight, touch, smell and taste, confusion and hallucinations, problems associated with the nose, gastric pains and urinary and bladder problems\nWithdrawal symptoms: depression, anger and irritability, fatigue, and insomnia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nNew Psychoactive Substances (NPS) 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Spice, K2, Bath Salts, Kronic, Bromo-Dragonfly, Mushroom, Synthetic Cannabis, BZP, TFMPP and Mephedrone, new psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances that mimic the effects of other controlled drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine, Ecstasy, methamphetamine or heroin. NPS are produced by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of existing NPS and controlled drugs to create new variations that are not yet controlled.\nEffects of use: severe intoxications, severe toxic reactions leading to death, paranoia, hallucinations, adverse cardiovascular problems, renal failure and seizures\nOpium3\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Aunti, Aunti Emma, Big O, O, Black pill, Chandu, Chinese Molasses, Dopium, Dream Gun, Fi-Do-Nie, Gee, Guma, Midnight Oil and Zero, Opium is a depressant drug derived from the opium poppy plant. It can be smoked, eaten raw or as a pill, or made into a tincture for drinking. It can also be manufactured into heroin and is a prerequisite for heroin production.\nEffects of short-term use: euphoria, relaxation, analgesia, slower, shallower breathing, lower heart rate, impaired reflexes, temporary constipation and loss of appetite\nEffects of long-term use: addiction, irregular periods and difficulty having children, loss of sex drive and constipation\nWithdrawal symptoms: restlessness and irritability, insomnia, depression and crying, diarrhoea, sweating, restless sleep, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting as well as fast heart rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nBuprenorphine2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Subutex, Tec and Su Su, Buprenorphine comes in 2 mg and 8 mg pills and is a semi-synthetic opioid derivative closely related to Morphine. It is taken sublingually i.e. place under the tongue until it dissolves. Abusers also mix it with other prescription drugs and inject it for a greater high\nEffects of use: sedation, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, vomiting\nWithdrawal symptoms: delirium tremens, clouding of consciousness and severe tremors or seizures, anxiety, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, muscle and joint pains and insomnia\nEcstasy2\n\n\n\n\n\nEcstasy refers to tablets containing Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) and/or Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). These tablets come in different colours with different logos stamped on them and are often sold in discos as well as night joints. People take them to enable them to dance all night and sometimes they die from exhaustion and dehydration. Other controlled drugs such as Ketamine and Ice, and chemicals such as paracetamol and calcium carbonate are often mixed with ecstasy by abusers.\nEffects of use: increased heart rate and blood pressure, jaw clenching, teeth grinding and uncontrollable shaking, kidney, liver and brain damage and long-term memory loss, chills, sweating and vomiting, inability to think, see and co-ordinate properly and hallucinations\nWithdrawal symptoms: anxiety, depression and uncontrollable fear, insomnia and loss of control of senses and reality\nErimin 52\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Nimetazepam, ‘Erimin-5’ is a type of depressant taken orally by the user in tablet form to help them to calm down and sleep.

    "text": "Also known as Glue-Sniffing, Solvent Abuse, Solvent Inhalation and Solvent Sniffing, Inhalant Abuse refers to the sniffing of vapours and fumes emitted by some substances, such as glue and paint thinner1. Inhalant abuse affects the growth and development of muscles, nerves and organs. For an inhalant abuser, normal activities like running and shouting can cause death by heart failure. They may also die from suffocation anytime. This is known as Sudden Sniffing Death and it can happen on the very first time or any other time the abuser sniffs glue.\nSome of the effects of inhalant abuse1 include permanent damage to brain, liver and kidneys, prone to bleeding and bruises, memory loss, difficulty in learning and seeing things clearly, loss of control of body as well as cramps, pains and bad cough.\nWithdrawal symptoms from inhalant abuse1 include anxiety, depression and irritability, aggressive behaviour, dizziness, shaking and nausea as well as insomnia.\nInhalant abuse is significant as inhalants are the most accessible form of substance in comparison to other drugs in Singapore, given that these substances can be purchased over the counter of hardware stores. As such, it is no wonder that drug abusers start out first with inhalant abuse before moving on to other drugs2. A survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) also found that 41.8% of drug abusers started consuming drugs before the age of 182. It should not be an exaggeration then that inhalant abuse could be a main factor and stepping stone for individuals to enter the realm of drug abuse, thus deserving attention and analysis."

In such cases, if found guilty, the abuser may be charged for drug consumption and acquire a criminal record.\nWithin the DRC, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) conducts intensive rehabilitation programmes tailored to the individuals’ rehabilitation needs. These encompass psychological interventions targeting drug use habits, family programmes enhancing relationship skills, and vocational training for employability to aid ex-abusers in reintegrating into society.\nThe DRC categorises abusers based on the risk of reoffending, with treatment lasting 12 months or more. Notably, in 2019, the rehabilitation regime expanded to include third-time and above repeat pure drug abusers, aiming to facilitate their reintegration into society.\nAfter release, individuals undergo urine and/or hair supervision to detect and deter potential relapse.\nThis CNA documentary compares the long path of drug rehabilitation in Singapore, Malaysia and the United States of America."

These encompass psychological interventions targeting drug use habits, family programmes enhancing relationship skills, and vocational training for employability to aid ex-abusers in reintegrating into society.\nThe DRC categorises abusers based on the risk of reoffending, with treatment lasting 12 months or more. Notably, in 2019, the rehabilitation regime expanded to include third-time and above repeat pure drug abusers, aiming to facilitate their reintegration into society.\nAfter release, individuals undergo urine and/or hair supervision to detect and deter potential relapse.\nThis CNA documentary compares the long path of drug rehabilitation in Singapore, Malaysia and the United States of America."

    "text": "Analysis & Implications of Trends of Drug Rehabilitation Centre Inmates in Singapore\nWhile the only publicly available statistics surrounding the inmates at the DRC are with regards to the total numbers of the inmates every year and their profiles2, they should still be able to provide some insight into the profiles of drug abusers, most of whom would have been subjected to the DRC. Unfortunately, the lack of provision of further details, such as the different lengths of the regimes being served by the inmates, their status as new or repeat inmates and the intersections of their profiles, severely limits the findings that can be obtained from these numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nThe number of inmates in the DRC has considerably increased over the years, with male inmates making a vast majority over the female inmates. Similar to the gender proportions of inhalant abusers arrested over the years, it can be concluded that men have a higher risk of engaging in drug abuse and thus be subjected to the DRC in comparison to women. Yet, the increasing numbers of inmates might be symptomatic of shortcomings of the Central Narcotics Bureau’s (CNB) Preventive Drug Education (PDE) and Structured Rehabilitation & Aftercare Programmes strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nOver the years, the number of inmates in the DRC within each age group has varied and fluctuated. However, the huge bulk of the inmates mainly and consistently occupy the age range from 20 to 60 while those outside this range remain relatively low. The considerably low number of youth inmates below 21 in the DRC might be the result of effective Preventive Drug Education (PDE) programmes in schools that have hindered most youths from approaching drug abuse. At the same time, the majority of inmates consistently being 20 to 60 years old highlights the need for the Preventive Drug Education (PDE) to also direct more focus on its programmes outside schools and at the workplace or other environments to target more adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nAmongst the inmates in the DRC, a large majority consistently consists of those with only secondary education level, followed by those with only primary education level and then by those with only vocational education level before the other education levels. While the numbers provided by the CNB2 here do not segment these groups further into age groups within each education level, it should be safe to assume based on the previous numbers on age groups of inmates in the DRC that most of those in each education level are no longer youth below 21. Along this line, most of those even in the three mentioned education level might have left school upon obtaining said highest education level. This further emphasises the need for greater focus of Preventive Drug Education (PDE) outside schools and at the workplace or other environments to target more adults instead of just youths.\n\n1Central Narcotics Bureau.

    "text": "Also known as Glue-Sniffing, Solvent Abuse, Solvent Inhalation and Solvent Sniffing, Inhalant Abuse refers to the sniffing of vapours and fumes emitted by some substances, such as glue and paint thinner1. Inhalant abuse affects the growth and development of muscles, nerves and organs. For an inhalant abuser, normal activities like running and shouting can cause death by heart failure. They may also die from suffocation anytime. This is known as Sudden Sniffing Death and it can happen on the very first time or any other time the abuser sniffs glue.\nSome of the effects of inhalant abuse1 include permanent damage to brain, liver and kidneys, prone to bleeding and bruises, memory loss, difficulty in learning and seeing things clearly, loss of control of body as well as cramps, pains and bad cough.\nWithdrawal symptoms from inhalant abuse1 include anxiety, depression and irritability, aggressive behaviour, dizziness, shaking and nausea as well as insomnia.\nInhalant abuse is significant as inhalants are the most accessible form of substance in comparison to other drugs in Singapore, given that these substances can be purchased over the counter of hardware stores. As such, it is no wonder that drug abusers start out first with inhalant abuse before moving on to other drugs2. A survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) also found that 41.8% of drug abusers started consuming drugs before the age of 182. It should not be an exaggeration then that inhalant abuse could be a main factor and stepping stone for individuals to enter the realm of drug abuse, thus deserving attention and analysis."

    "text": "Analysis & Implications of Trends of Inhalant Abusers in Singapore\nWhile the real numbers of inhalant abusers in Singapore cannot realistically be obtained, the number of such abusers arrested3 should give some form of reliable indication given the pervasive nature of the country’s surveillance and law enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nThere has been an overall decline in the number of new and repeat inhalant abusers being arrested. The decreasing number of repeat abusers might be indicative of the effectiveness of the Central Narcotics Bureau’s (CNB) strategy of Structured Rehabilitation & Aftercare Programmes. The number of new abusers that was once consistently higher than that of repeat abusers has evolved to become consistently lower than the latter, hinting at the effectiveness of CNB’s Preventive Drug Education (PDE) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nInhalant abusers being arrested consistently tend to be male rather than female. This can possibly be deduced to mean that men tend to be at higher risk of engaging in inhalant abuse than women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nThe trend of inhalant abusers being arrested preponderantly consisting of youth below 20 seems to have diminished over the years with a largely proportional number of abusers hailing from each age group. Some might argue that this indicates the effectiveness of CNB’s Structured Rehabilitation & Aftercare Programmes, namely the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC), Drug Supervision Scheme (DSS) and Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC). However, this contradicts the findings of the IMH survey2 that suggest that youths make up a significant number of drug abusers. Thus, this trend being displayed might not be truly indicative of the real numbers of inhalant abusers on the ground as they could potentially be becoming more adept at avoiding being caught and arrested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nEarlier on, there seems to be a propensity of overrepresentation of Chinese and Malays amongst inhalant abusers arrested. However, the numbers have decreased and become more proportional across all ethnicities over the years. Even so, the Chinese seem to still consistently have the highest representation. Some might laud the effectiveness of the “Dadah itu Haram” campaign launched by the CNB in 2017 that works with Malay-Muslim organisations and the community to tackle the supposed over-representation of Malays involved with drugs4. Perhaps, a similar move could be considered specifically for the Chinese community too.\n\n1Central Narcotics Bureau. (2023, July 13).

Heroin No. 4 is white in colour while Heroin No. 3 is more yellowish. Heroin abusers feel dull and tired very easily and are also not able to concentrate. “Chasing the Dragon” is a common method of abuse used by Heroin abusers here that involves heating the Heroin powder and sniffing the fumes through a rolled note.\nEffects of use: lowered heart rate and respiration, damage to lungs, kidneys and liver, dull feeling and tiredness, difficulty in concentrating and constipation\nWithdrawal symptoms: insomnia, watery eyes and runny nose, irritable and jittery feelings, tremors and bodily cramps, chills and sweating as well as diarrhoea and vomiting\nIce2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Methamphetamine, Glass, Crystal, Speed, Quartz, Ice Cream, Hirropon, Shabu or Syabu that usually comes in the form of a colourless and odourless crystal that resembles glass fragments or shiny blue-white “rocks” of various sizes. It is highly addictive and is a strong stimulant, with a very strong effect on the central nervous system.\nEffects of use/Withdrawal symptoms: disorientation, apathy, confused exhaustion, strong psychological dependence, psychosis, depression, damage to the brain similar to Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and epilepsy, aggression and violent behaviour, anxiety, confusion, insomnia and auditory hallucinations\nPhysical effects of use: permanent damage to blood vessels of heart and brain, high blood pressure leading to heart attacks, strokes and death, liver, kidney and lung damage, destruction of tissues in nose if sniffed, respiratory (breathing) problems if smoked, infectious diseases and abscesses if injected, malnutrition, weight loss and severe tooth decay\nKetamine2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as K, Special K, Vitamin K and Kit Kat, Ketamine is an anaesthetic for veterinary as well as human use and the drug takes the form of a white crystalline powder, liquid or tablet. As a drug of abuse in Hong Kong, the United States and Australia, it has become common at dance parties. It produces a progression of effects on the abuser, from a state of dreamy intoxication to delirium accompanied by the inability to move, feel pain or remember what has occurred under the drug’s influence. The effects of Ketamine last an hour or less but the drug can affect the senses, judgement and co-ordination for 18 to 24 hours.\nEffects of use: inability to move, distorted judgement, perception, hearing, sight, touch, smell and taste, confusion and hallucinations, problems associated with the nose, gastric pains and urinary and bladder problems\nWithdrawal symptoms: depression, anger and irritability, fatigue, and insomnia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nNew Psychoactive Substances (NPS) 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Spice, K2, Bath Salts, Kronic, Bromo-Dragonfly, Mushroom, Synthetic Cannabis, BZP, TFMPP and Mephedrone, new psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to substances that mimic the effects of other controlled drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine, Ecstasy, methamphetamine or heroin. NPS are produced by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of existing NPS and controlled drugs to create new variations that are not yet controlled.\nEffects of use: severe intoxications, severe toxic reactions leading to death, paranoia, hallucinations, adverse cardiovascular problems, renal failure and seizures\nOpium3\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Aunti, Aunti Emma, Big O, O, Black pill, Chandu, Chinese Molasses, Dopium, Dream Gun, Fi-Do-Nie, Gee, Guma, Midnight Oil and Zero, Opium is a depressant drug derived from the opium poppy plant. It can be smoked, eaten raw or as a pill, or made into a tincture for drinking. It can also be manufactured into heroin and is a prerequisite for heroin production.\nEffects of short-term use: euphoria, relaxation, analgesia, slower, shallower breathing, lower heart rate, impaired reflexes, temporary constipation and loss of appetite\nEffects of long-term use: addiction, irregular periods and difficulty having children, loss of sex drive and constipation\nWithdrawal symptoms: restlessness and irritability, insomnia, depression and crying, diarrhoea, sweating, restless sleep, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting as well as fast heart rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Interact with the graph to view the values)\nBuprenorphine2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Subutex, Tec and Su Su, Buprenorphine comes in 2 mg and 8 mg pills and is a semi-synthetic opioid derivative closely related to Morphine. It is taken sublingually i.e. place under the tongue until it dissolves. Abusers also mix it with other prescription drugs and inject it for a greater high\nEffects of use: sedation, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, vomiting\nWithdrawal symptoms: delirium tremens, clouding of consciousness and severe tremors or seizures, anxiety, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, muscle and joint pains and insomnia\nEcstasy2\n\n\n\n\n\nEcstasy refers to tablets containing Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) and/or Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). These tablets come in different colours with different logos stamped on them and are often sold in discos as well as night joints. People take them to enable them to dance all night and sometimes they die from exhaustion and dehydration. Other controlled drugs such as Ketamine and Ice, and chemicals such as paracetamol and calcium carbonate are often mixed with ecstasy by abusers.\nEffects of use: increased heart rate and blood pressure, jaw clenching, teeth grinding and uncontrollable shaking, kidney, liver and brain damage and long-term memory loss, chills, sweating and vomiting, inability to think, see and co-ordinate properly and hallucinations\nWithdrawal symptoms: anxiety, depression and uncontrollable fear, insomnia and loss of control of senses and reality\nErimin 52\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as Nimetazepam, ‘Erimin-5’ is a type of depressant taken orally by the user in tablet form to help them to calm down and sleep. Excessive use will however lead to harmful effects.\nEffects of use: loss of consciousness, distorted judgement, sight and thinking, difficulty in speaking, moving and co-ordinating bodily functions as well as poor memory and concentration\nWithdrawal symptoms: anxiety and jittery feelings, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, quickened heart beat, excessive sweating, violent shaking and stomach cramps, mental confusion and fits\nYaba2\n\n\n\n\n\nA variant of Ice or Methamphetamine in tablet form, it is also known as Crazy Horse Pill. Most of the Yaba tablets found in Singapore are embossed with the ‘WY’ logo and are green or orange in colour. It is highly addictive and is a strong stimulant, with a very strong effect on the central nervous system.\nEffects of use/Withdrawal symptoms: disorientation, apathy, confused exhaustion, strong psychological dependence, psychosis, depression, damage to the brain similar to Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and epilepsy, aggression and violent behaviour, anxiety, confusion, insomnia and auditory hallucinations\nPhysical effects of use: permanent damage to blood vessels of heart and brain, high blood pressure leading to heart attacks, strokes and death, liver, kidney and lung damage, destruction of tissues in nose if sniffed, respiratory (breathing) problems if smoked, infectious diseases and abscesses if injected, malnutrition, weight loss and severe tooth decay"

    "text": "Analysis & Implications of Trends of Drug Types in Singapore\nWhile the statistics on each type of drug seized in Singapore over the years as displayed here can provide some form of a reliable illustration of the popular drug types and the demand for them, they should not be taken as fully indicative of the actual trends on the ground. For instance, some drug types could be significant yet not reflected here due to more covert operations that have thus far managed to escape surveillance and enforcement. However, due to the lack of such data, the current statistics available on drug types seized remain the most reliable form of data for analysis of their popularity.\nOverall, there have been differing trends for different types of drugs from 2003 to 2021. Some have boomed in popularity, some have grown out of significance, others have remained stagnantly present. It is crucial to study the local trends surrounding these particular drugs, and their correlations with global drug trends, to be able to design more targeted and effective solutions such as in the form of aftercare programmes for abusers as well as enforcement strategies to root out and seize drug hotspots.\nDrugs that have ostensibly been increasing in popularity include Cannabis, Heroin, Ice and New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).\nMeanwhile, drugs that seem to have been losing or lost popularity include Heroin No.4, Opium, Buprenorphine, Erimin 5 and Yaba.\nDrugs that have largely stagnated while persisting are Ketamine and Ecstasy.\nBased on these deductions, the CNB could direct their strategies and resources to focus more on drugs that have been increasing in popularity as well as those that have persisted despite stagnating. While data on tendency of abuse of certain types of drugs amongst different age groups is not publicly available at the moment, the CNB could derive certain patterns from their own records to better inform its strategies of Preventive Drug Education (PDE) and Structured Rehabilitation & Aftercare Programmes.\nFor instance, since Ketamine is recognised as being common at dance parties2, the CNB could channel their efforts into surveillance and enforcement at places like night clubs and dance party events to seize potential drug abusers and suppliers. The rising trend of Cannabis seems to also be in line with greater attention on the substances and shifting attitudes towards it given its increasing legalisation around the world4. It is also popular as a first drug in Singapore, according to a survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)5. This CNA documentary examines the reasons for the growing popularity of the drug amongst youths.\n\n\n1Central Narcotics Bureau. (2022).
